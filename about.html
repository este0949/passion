            <p class="project-text"><span class="accent">30 go to 30</span> is all about making your free time worth a while. The following 30 squares were carefully curated to make sure you get to see the best of Copenhagen places to chill, places to party and after all that, places to get your energy back - to drink good coffee and eat. Being under 30 and having way too many choices can make you go crazy, we know. Don’t worry though, we got you! </p>

            <h2 class="team-title">The Team</h2>
            <p class="team-text"><span class="accent">We are</span> three international Multimedia Design students excited about life outside our apartment walls. We haven’t found it easy to gather information about where to go when you’re new in town though, and only wished there was a website with a taste we could trust. So we made one.
            If you’re like us and you appreciate music, always think of fast techno on the weekends, find yourself craving for a sweet almond croissant, feel affectionate about places to brunch while thinking about where to buy that record on the way to your most favorite gallery, stay and read on. We made this website for you too.
            We are always happy to learn about new gems so if you have something in mind, let us know, we probably would want to go.
